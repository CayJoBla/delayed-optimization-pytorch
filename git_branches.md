# <center> Organize Git Branches </center>

## Changes
- For now, keep 'hyperparameter-extension' and 'supercomputer' separate
    * Eventually, I should merge 'hyperparameter-extension' into 'master' (after master is FF'd to 'rosen_zak_effects')
- After merging, add a branch to reorganize the code
    * Keep notebooks, results, and scripts, but organize into folders
    * Source code should have some directory structure
